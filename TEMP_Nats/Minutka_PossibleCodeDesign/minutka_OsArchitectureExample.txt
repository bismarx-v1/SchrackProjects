3 tasks(functions that run basically paralel to each other (not really))
	- names
		- State
		- Graphics
		- Outputs(Display driver)
	
	- what each task does
		- State
			- Decides what to set an "internal state" variable (just a concept) to based on the current state and currently pressed buttons

		- Graphics
			- Decides what to display based on the "internal state" variable

		- Outputs
			- Handles outputing the right stuff based on what the "Graphics" task throws at it
			- Can be handled in the "Graphics" task instead

	- Pros for using tasks
		- Once you know what you are doing it becomes easy and readable
		- Each task can run with a different period

	- Cons
		- More stuff to learn

	- Addition
		- These tasks don't defaultly exist. there is just a way to make them
		- Probs better to just slap it all in one loop
			- like
				- check_buttons();
				- process_state();
				- render_output();
				- output_stuff();
				- repeat
		
		- how can the "internal state" var work, an example
			- values of the state
				- 0 => error screen
				- 1 => main menu (screen shows 0s)
				- 2 => counting up(ctu)
				- 3 => ctu paused
				- 4 => select count down(ctd) time
				- 5 => counting down
				- 6 => ctd ended

or something, why/how should i know ^w^
wish i didn't have to wake up, like ever again :3
